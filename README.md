# Gears & Grains

## Info

This site is my first React portfolio project. Gears & Grains is a fictional bakery that a friend of mine and I talked about creating one day.

## Why I Chose this Project

I thought creating a website for this imaginary bakery would be a great way to practice creating store-front pages. I wanted to create a clean and simplistic single-page application that was easy to navigate. (Find original wireframe here: https://www.figma.com/file/bdOGTHhhrzrKuAyNr2zBBT/Gears-and-Grains?node-id=0%3A1)

My choice of colors (or lack of) was to push the users' focus to the photos throughout the components and avoid overloading the page with too much to take in. I also chose to largely use white as it is associated with cleanliness (important for a place that makes and sells food).

## Challenges

A large portion of this application is static, and done using ReactStrap. I wanted to do more with these components, however, due to time limitations I was forced to go this route. This also limited my ability to implement Redux in this app.

## Future Plans

My current plans are to make adjustments to how data is handled throughout this application, including implementing Redux. I also plan to create a mobile app for this page. Longer term, I wish to add a shopping-cart functionality that gets filled when the user adds an item to their order in the order modal.
